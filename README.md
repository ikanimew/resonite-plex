This is the project for the Plex Media Player, created within the Resonite platform for the 2022 Metaverse Maker Competition. The player has been given several updates since then to make it behave better on Resonite.

To get the Player, paste the following into Resonite:

resrec:///G-DCN/R-1d5ad104-da0d-444b-a74b-01ad015aeb66

This will spawn a shared folder with the current version of the player within. Spawn out the player, and fill in the Plex Server hostname, and authentication token.

See: https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/ for how to get your authentication token.

Please feel free to submit any issues you spot in the Issues section. Since the player is written in ProtoFlux, I can't exactly do git checkins, so the Issues section and the Wiki will be the two primary uses of this project.
